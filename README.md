## HiFlipVX

The image processing library is a template based library that provides basic image processing functions for streaming applications. The functions should at least support the OpenVX specification. Additionally, more data types and auto-vectorization are supported for all functions. Image data for the SDSoC functions can be in 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit fix-point representation (unsigned/signed). At this state, the library consists of two types of functions: windowed and pixel-wise operations.
